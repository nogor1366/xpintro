### Compozed

Allstate’s internal effort, CompoZed, is a radical new way of thinking, acting and delivering software solutions to enhance the Allstate customer experience. 
The core services provided by CompoZed are product management, user experience design, Agile/ test driven software development and self-service infrastructure management. 

Note: 
Traditionally Allstate used waterfall development methodology to delivery software.  Compozed represents a change to include Agile methods - Scrum and XP.  This presentation will focus on Agile XP

Note: Compozed has labs across the world.  In each lab multiple teams operate.  Every team is cross functional, comprising a product manager, developers and designer.

### XP Agile can seem a bit overwhelming intially

Note: 
XP Agile introduces many concepts which may be new to anyone who has worked exlusively with waterfall methodology.

XP is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software and  higher quality of life for developers

Note: 
This summary statement goes to the heart of what XP intends to be.
To make sense of what can feel like a complicated jigsaw, let us look at the values, principles and practices which XP is founded on.

### XP values, principle and practices

Note: 
The values can be thought of as somewhat abstract, the practices are specific processes, the principles then are the guidelines which bridge the abstract to the concrete

### XP values


- Communication <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 
- Simplicity <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Feedback <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Courage <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Respect <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: 
Constantly communicate with users and team members, share knowledge at pair/team/lab level
Keep design simple and clean, design for today not an immagined tomorrow
Get feedback - from system testing from day one; from customer; from team at planning and retro
Courage - refactor continously, persistence to solve intractable problems;  respond to changing requirements and technology
Respect the team by celebrating sucess and giving honest and kind feedback, respect fellow developers by writing clean code and only commiting passing tests

### XP Practices

Note:
Paired programming - all production code produced by a pair, one has control and codes, the other has big picture and reviews; trade roles;two eyes better than one
TDD - write tests before code, minimal tests, red-green-refactor
Refactoring - look for duplicate code, implement clean coding practices
Keep design and code simple

+++

### XP Practices

Note:
Continous integration - team working on latest version of code, changes and improvements merged into the repository every few hours
Collective code ownership - everyone responsible for all the code, anyone can change anything, no “owners” or “heros”
Coding standard - agreed rules for entire team
Sustainable pace - developers work best when rested, should not work overtime, take regular breaks to refresh mind.  Well tested, continuously integrated and deployed code should minimize production outages and associated after-hours work

+++

### XP Practices

Note:
Planning or IPM - meeting once a week to plan release (what to deliver when) and iteration (developer activities)
Whole team - the user is part of the team
Small releases - delivery is incremental, help customer gain condfidence
Customer tests -
